# Public-Transport-Simulation
An idea while taking the train. All roads lead to Rome, so where to all public transportation routes lead to? A fun look into taking public transportation.

Nodes should include both Bus Stops, Train Stations and Interchanges.

Behaviours to test
1) Start at a random node, take the first avaliable public transportation at that node, flip a coin to decide whether to alight on arrival or to continue the journey.
2) Start at a random node, take the first avaliable public transportation at that node, alight at the end of the planned route and continue.
